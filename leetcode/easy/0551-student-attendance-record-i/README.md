# Student Attendance Record I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- 'A': Absent.
- 'L': Late.
- 'P': Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet  **both**  of the following criteria:

- The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
- The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

Return `true` *if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either 'A', 'L', or 'P'.

        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]=='A'){
                a++;
            }else if(s[i]=='L'){
                l++;
                if(s[i+1]=='L' && s[i+2]=='L'){
                    flag=1;
                }
            }else if(s[i]=='P'){
                p++;
            }
        }
        if(a<2 && flag==0){
            return true;
        }else return false;
        
    }
};
