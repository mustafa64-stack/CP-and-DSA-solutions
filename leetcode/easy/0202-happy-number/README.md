# Happy Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A  **happy number**  is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true`  *if*  `n`  *is a happy number, and*  `false`  *if not*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> vis;
        while(n!=1 && !vis.count(n)){
            vis.insert(n);
            int x=0;
            for(;n;n/=10){
                x+=(n%10)*(n%10);
            }
            n=x;
        }
        return n==1;
    }
};
```
